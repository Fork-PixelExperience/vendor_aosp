      "message": "What\u0027s the point of TARGET_ENFORCE_QSSI flag when your first commit (1/2) already links os_pickup_qssi.mk unconditionally in manifest? Also, the name of the flag indicates it works for every \"target\", but in reality it only changes things for 8953. Something like \"MSM8953_ENFORCES_QSSI\" would be more appropriate. (Note that it\u0027s ENFORCES not ENFORCE, following the same grammatic style as TARGET_USES_XXX and BOARD_USES_XXX.)",
